### I'm looking to create a real-world application using the COVID public API to display all vaccine appointments in each state. I'm looking towards expanding from this intial UI and to create more functionalities from here on. 


Initial deploy:
https://covid-vaccine-dashboard.netlify.app/



### 4/2/21 - 4/3-21:
I learned how CI/CD works in Azure DevOps platform. I hosted this project in Azure by importing it from GitHub and then seting up the trigger, build pipeline, and release pipeline so that each time I make a commit to GitHub, it will automatically build and deploy the newest commit from GitHub.
