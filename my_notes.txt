All vaccination locations are listed, but appointment availability is currently only shown for some local Board of Health sites and CVS. For locations not providing their availability, click "Details" to visit their scheduling link for appointment information.

                    If you are eligible for a vaccination you can preregister to be notified when an appointment is available to schedule at one of the 7 mass vaccination locations. Learn more about preregistration.

                    States receives a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccine doses from the federal government each week. Due to high demand and very limited supply, there are only a small number of available appointments.
